# Disruptions Map

http://data.tfl.gov.uk/tfl/syndication/feeds/tims_feed.xml?app_id=&app_key=

This feed was built to replace the Live Traffic Disruptions (LTIS) feed, which was decommissioned on 1 April 2013.

The structure and the content of the new feed has been changed to capture a richer range of information about road disruptions, including improved spatial information, details of closures and more in-depth categorisation of the cause of a disruption.
